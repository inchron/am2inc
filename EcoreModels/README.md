# Ecore Models

## Amalthea

The current AMALTHEA model can be found here:

https://www.eclipse.org/app4mc/help/app4mc-0.9.8/zip/ecore-definitions.zip

Note that the version number is part of the URL.

Before AMALTHEA.ecore can be processed by emf4cpp, some minor changes are
required. These are implemented by ../Amalthea/adaptC++.sh. The commit version
already incorporates these changes.
