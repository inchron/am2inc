# Ecore Models

## Amalthea

The current AMALTHEA model can be found here:

https://eclipse.dev/app4mc/help/latest/zip/ecore-definitions.zip

Before AMALTHEA.ecore can be processed by emf4cpp, some minor changes are
required. These are implemented by ../Amalthea/adaptC++.sh. The commit version
already incorporates these changes.
